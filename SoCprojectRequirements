SPI Module 
		* CS pin signifies start of data
		* TX 8-32 bits
		* our design will have the ability to support 4 devices (multiple chip selects)

SPI Data-Rate
	* 50MHZ/(X)

optional part of the project
	* SPI Dack with transmit, clk ,and chip select
		* 16 bit D/A converter at (16b @ clock rate = output)
